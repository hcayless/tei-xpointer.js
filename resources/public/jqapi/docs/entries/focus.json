This event is implicitly applicable to a limited set of elements, such as  form elements (<code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, etc.) and links (<code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>). In recent browser versions, the event can be extended to include all element types by explicitly setting the element's <code>tabindex</code> property. An element can gain focus via keyboard commands, such as the Tab key, or by mouse clicks on the element.</li>\n      <li>Elements with focus are usually highlighted in some way by the browser, for example with a dotted line surrounding the element. The focus is used to determine which element is the first to receive keyboard-related events.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Attempting to set focus to a hidden element causes an error in Internet Explorer. Take care to only use <code>.focus()</code> on elements that are visible. To run an element's focus event handlers without setting focus to the element, use <code>.triggerHandler(\"focus\")</code> instead of <code>.focus()</code>.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>\n    <pre><code>&lt;form&gt;\n  &lt;input id=\"target\" type=\"text\" value=\"Field 1\" /&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"text\" value=\"Field 2\" /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"other\"&gt;\n  Trigger the handler\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n    <p>The event handler can be bound to the first input field:</p>\n    <pre><code>$('#target').focus(function() {\n  alert('Handler for .focus() called.');\n});</code></pre>\n    <p>Now clicking on the first field, or tabbing to it from another field, displays the alert:</p>\n    <p>\n      <span class=\"output\">Handler for .focus() called.</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>We can trigger the event when another element is clicked:</p>\n    <pre><code>$('#other').click(function() {\n  $('#target').focus();\n});</code></pre>\n    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <span class=\"output\">Trigger the handler</span> will also alert the message.</p>\n    <p>The <code>focus</code> event does not bubble in Internet Explorer. Therefore, scripts that rely on event delegation with the <code>focus</code> event will not work consistently across browsers. As of version 1.4.2, however, jQuery works around this limitation by mapping <code>focus</code> to the <code>focusin</code> event in its event delegation methods, <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/live/\"><code>.live()</code></a> and <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/delegate/\"><code>.delegate()</code></a>.</p>\n  "}]}
