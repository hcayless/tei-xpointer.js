Instead, use <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/off/\"><code>.off()</code></a> to remove event handlers bound with <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/on/\"><code>.on()</code></a></p>\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In order for .die() to function correctly, the selector used with it must match exactly the selector initially used with .live().</p>\n  "}]}
