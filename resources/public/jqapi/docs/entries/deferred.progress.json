When the Deferred generates progress notifications by calling <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyWith</code>, the <code>progressCallbacks</code> are called. Since <code>deferred.progress()</code> returns the Deferred object, other methods of the Deferred object can be chained to this one. When the Deferred is resolved or rejected, progress callbacks will no longer be called, with the exception that any <code>progressCallbacks</code> added after the Deferred enters the resolved or rejected state are executed immediately when they are added, using the arguments that were passed to the <code>.notify()</code> or <code>notifyWith()</code> call.
