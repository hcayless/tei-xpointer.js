The Promise exposes only the Deferred methods needed to attach additional handlers or determine the state (<code>then</code>, <code>done</code>, <code>fail</code>, <code>always</code>, <code>pipe</code>, <code>progress</code>, and <code>state</code>), but not ones that change the state (<code>resolve</code>, <code>reject</code>, <code>notify</code>, <code>resolveWith</code>, <code>rejectWith</code>, and <code>notifyWith</code>).</p>\n    <p>If <code>target</code> is provided, <code>deferred.promise()</code> will attach the methods onto it and then return this object rather than create a new one. This can be useful to attach the Promise behavior to an object that already exists.</p>\n    <p>If you are creating a Deferred, keep a reference to the Deferred so that it can be resolved or rejected at some point. Return <em>only</em> the Promise object via <code>deferred.promise()</code> so other code can register callbacks or inspect the current state.</p>\n    <p>For more information, see the documentation for <a href=\"/category/deferred-object/\">Deferred object</a>.</p>\n  "}]}
