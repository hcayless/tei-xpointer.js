There are several known caveats with this that should be noted. These are:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>It doesn't work consistently nor reliably cross-browser</li>\n          <li>It doesn't fire correctly in WebKit if the image src is set to the same src as before</li>\n          <li>It doesn't correctly bubble up the DOM tree</li>\n          <li>Can cease to fire for images that already live in the browser's cache</li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>.live()</code> and <code>.delegate()</code> methods cannot be used to detect the <code>load</code> event of an iframe. The load event does not correctly bubble up the parent document and the event.target isn't set by Firefox, IE9 or Chrome, which is required to do event delegation.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  "}],"slug":"load-event"}
