They narrow the set down based on the order of the elements within this matched set. For example, if elements are first selected with a class selector (<code>.myclass</code>) and four elements are returned, these elements are given indices 0 through 3 for the purposes of these selectors.</p>\n    <p>Note that since JavaScript arrays use <em>0-based indexing</em>, these selectors reflect that fact. This is why <code>$('.myclass:lt(1)')</code> selects the first element in the document with the class <code>myclass</code>, rather than selecting no elements. In contrast, <code>:nth-child(n)</code> uses <em>1-based indexing</em> to conform to the CSS specification.</p>\n  "}],"slug":"lt-selector"}
