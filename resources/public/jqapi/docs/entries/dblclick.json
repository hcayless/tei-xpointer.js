Any HTML element can receive this event.\n    For example, consider the HTML:</p>\n    <pre><code>&lt;div id=\"target\"&gt;\n  Double-click here\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"other\"&gt;\n  Trigger the handler\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n    <p class=\"image\">\n      <img src=\"/resources/0042_05_04.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The event handler can be bound to any <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>\n    <pre><code>$('#target').dblclick(function() {\n  alert('Handler for .dblclick() called.');\n});</code></pre>\n    <p>Now double-clicking on this element displays the alert:</p>\n    <p>\n      <span class=\"output\">Handler for .dblclick() called.</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>To trigger the event manually, apply <code>.dblclick()</code> without an argument:</p>\n    <pre><code>$('#other').click(function() {\n  $('#target').dblclick();\n});</code></pre>\n    <p>After this code executes, (single) clicks on <span class=\"output\">Trigger the handler</span> will also alert the message.</p>\n    <p>The <code>dblclick</code> event is only triggered after this exact series of events:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>The mouse button is depressed while the pointer is inside the element.</li>\n      <li>The mouse button is released while the pointer is inside the element.</li>\n      <li>The mouse button is depressed again while the pointer is inside the element, within a time window that is system-dependent.</li>\n      <li>The mouse button is released while the pointer is inside the element.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>It is inadvisable to bind handlers to both the <code>click</code> and <code>dblclick</code> events for the same element. The sequence of events triggered varies from browser to browser, with some receiving two <code>click</code> events before the <code>dblclick</code> and others only one. Double-click sensitivity (maximum time between clicks that is detected as a double click) can vary by operating system and browser, and is often user-configurable.\n    </p>\n  "}]}
