Any HTML element can receive this event.</p>\n    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>\n    <pre><code>&lt;div id=\"target\"&gt;\n  Click here\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"other\"&gt;\n  Trigger the handler\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n    <p class=\"image\">\n      <img src=\"/resources/0042_05_02.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The event handler can be bound to any <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>\n    <pre><code>$('#target').mouseup(function() {\n  alert('Handler for .mouseup() called.');\n});\n</code></pre>\n    <p>Now if we click on this element, the alert is displayed:</p>\n    <p>\n      <span class=\"output\">Handler for .mouseup() called.</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>We can also trigger the event when a different element is clicked:</p>\n    <pre><code>$('#other').click(function() {\n  $('#target').mouseup();\n});</code></pre>\n    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <span class=\"output\">Trigger the handler</span> will also alert the message.</p>\n    <p>If the user clicks outside an element, drags onto it, and releases the button, this is still counted as a <code>mouseup</code> event. This sequence of actions is not treated as a button press in most user interfaces, so it is usually better to use the <code>click</code> event unless we know that the <code>mouseup</code> event is preferable for a particular situation.</p>\n  "}]}
