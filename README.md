# dll - Digital Latin Library Annotation Prototype

This repository contains a partially-functional mockup of an XML annotation service. It utilizes code from jQuery, Rangy, and TEI Boilerplate to enable the display of unmodified XML documents in the browser. The xpointer.js and annotate.js code handles the resolution of TEI Pointers within the documents.
